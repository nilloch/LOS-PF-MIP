# LOS-PF-MIP
Julia Implementation of a Mixed-Integer Program with constraints that ensure agents respect obstacles, maintain a connected network,  and produce viable paths while estimating the position of an unknown network node using particle filters. Built upon prior work, which can be found at https://github.com/nilloch/LOS-Network-MIP.

Created by Collin Hudson as a final project for ASEN 5519 "Autonomous Bayesian Reasoning" Spring 2025
